# check_authorship.sh: verify who wrote each commit.
#
# Every commit's author, committer, and any co-author must be an approved
# identity. Anything else is blocked. Fail-closed: an unapproved identity, or no
# configured list at all, stops the commit or push. This is an identity gate,
# not a keyword filter: it does not name or single out any one tool, it simply
# refuses anyone who is not on the approved list.
#
# One rule, three layers:
#   - .githooks/commit-msg  (at commit time)
#   - .githooks/pre-push    (the commits being pushed)
#   - .github/workflows/authorship-guard.yml  (required check on main)
#
# The approved list is data, not code, and carries no address in the tracked
# tree (the repo forbids PII in source):
#   - APPROVED_AUTHORS  env, space or newline separated (CI sets it from the
#     AUTHORSHIP_ALLOW repository variable), and/or
#   - .githooks/authors.allow  gitignored, one address per line.
# Two public GitHub no-reply addresses are always allowed as committers so the
# web merge button and Actions commits pass.
#
# Usage:
#   check_authorship.sh <range...>   e.g. origin/main..HEAD, or  <sha> --not --remotes
#   check_authorship.sh              no arg: every local commit not on a remote
